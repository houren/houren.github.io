About me
======

My name is Irene-Angelica Chounta and currently I hold an Assistant (Junior) Professorship on “Computational Methods in Modeling and Analysis of Learning Processes” in the Department of “Computer Science and Applied Cognitive Science” (INKO) of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Duisburg-Essen. My research focuses on computational learning analytics for technology-enhanced learning and educational technologies. My main research interest is to model learners' behaviour in order to provide adaptive and personalized feedback, either in formal or informal contexts.

Background
======

I was born and raised in Athens, Greece. I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering in the University of Patras, where I also completed my PhD on Educational Technologies and Human-Computer Interaction.

From April 2018 to March 2021, I held a Senior Researcher joint position in the Institute of Education and in the Institute of Computer Science in University of Tartu. During my time in Tartu, I received a personal start-up grant from the Estonian Research Council for combining machine-learning and learning-analytics to design personalized, adaptive feedback for online courses.
From April 2016 to March 2018, I worked at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute in Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, USA) with Prof. Bruce McLaren on a collaborative project between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University ("Rimac: Improving a Natural-language Tutoring System that Engages Students in Deep Reasoning Dialogues about Physics"). The project aimed to develop and use a student model to support the adaptation of tutorial dialogues for a physics intelligent tutoring system.

From August 2014 to March 2016, I worked in the Collide Group at the Department of Computational and Cognitive Sciences, University of Duisburg-Essen (Germany) with Prof. Ulrich H. Hoppe. During my time there, we explored the use of learning analytics to scaffold the communication in MOOCs, to support learning activities through online labs and to foster creativity and reflection in maker events, such as Hackathons.

I believe that education is the answer to many questions, along with kindness and understanding. I also believe in working together to achieving common goals.

Other than that, I enjoy traveling around the world and I try to learn something new every day.
